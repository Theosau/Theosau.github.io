  I am an Advanced Technologies & Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.arup.com/Arup" target="_blank">Arup</a>, where I work on machine learning, fluid dynamics and sustainability. 
  My journey through mechanical engineering and computer science has taught me a lot about the power of combining these fields to solve real-world problems. It's about making software 
  that not only thinks but also understands the physical world it operates in. This approach, guided by first principles reasoning, has been at the heart of my projects.
  <!-- I  have 5+ years 
  of demonstrated experience in programming, building ML, deep learning, and symbolic AI models for various
  applications such as computer vision, physical modeling and behavioural understanding (in criminology). I love challenging 
  projects which require building innovative and creative solutions, to positively impact society. -->

  I recieved an BEng in Mechanical Engineering and an MSc in Computer Science (AI
  and ML) from Imperial College London, and an MS in Mechanical Engineering from UC Berkeley. During these, I had the chance 
  of collaborating with researchers such as
  <a href="https://me.berkeley.edu/people/shawn-shadden/" target="_blank">Shawn C. Shadden</a>.
  <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.navarro" target="_blank">Salvador Navarro-Martinez</a>, 
  <a href="http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/arusso/" target="_blank">Alessandra Russo</a>, and 
  <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~da04/" target="_blank">Dalal Alrajeh</a>.

  In the summer 2022, I worked in <a href="https://www.ansys.com/" target="_blank">Ansys'</a> San Jose CTO team on a 
  new generation of PDE numerical solvers powered by physics informred ML. Previously, I gained industrial experience in 
  different tech-focused start-ups: I applied ML to supply chain challenges at 
  <a href="https://www.vekia.fr/en/homepage/" target="_blank">Vekia</a>, and to quality control
  and anomaly detection on images at <a href="https://scortex.io/" target="_blank">Scortex</a> (which has been aqcuired by
  <a href="https://www.trigo-group.com/en" target="_blank">Trigo</a> group).
