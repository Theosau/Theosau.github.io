  I am a PhD sutdent in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley, where I work on Physics Informed Machine Learning (ML) and 
  Accelerating Physics Numerical Simulations with ML, advised by 
  <a href="https://me.berkeley.edu/people/philip-s-marcus/" target="_blank">Philip Marcus</a>. I have 4+ years 
  of demonstrated experience in programming, building ML, deep learning, and symbolic AI models for various
  applications such as computer vision, physical modeling and behaviour understanding (in criminology).

  Prior to joinging Berkeley, I recieved an MEng in Mechanical Engineering and an MSc in Computing (Specialism AI
  and ML), both from Imperial College London. During these, I had the chance of collaborating with researchers 
  such as <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.navarro" target="_blank">Salvador Navarro-Martinez</a>, 
  <a href="http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/arusso/" target="_blank">Alessandra Russo</a>, and 
  <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~da04/" target="_blank">Dalal Alrajeh</a>.

  I have industrial experience gained in different tech-focused start-ups. I applied ML to supply chain challenges at
  <a href="https://www.vekia.fr/en/homepage/" target="_blank">Vekia</a>, and to quality control
  and anomaly detection on images at <a href="https://scortex.io/" target="_blank">Scortex</a>.
