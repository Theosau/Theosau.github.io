<p align="justify">
  I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley, where I work on Physics Informed Machine Learning 
  (ML) for cardio-vascular and personalized applications, advised by
  <a href="https://me.berkeley.edu/people/shawn-shadden/" target="_blank">Prof. Shawn Shadden</a>. I have 5+ years 
  of demonstrated experience in programming, building ML, deep learning, and symbolic AI models for various
  applications such as computer vision, physical modeling and behavioural understanding (in criminology). I love challenging 
  projects which require building innovative and creative solutions, to positively impact society.

I wish to combine my experience in computer science and mechanical engeineering to build innovative products. I am currently working on 
personalized medicine application, and have led a group of 5 to develop a bionic hand for below-elbow amputees in the past.

  Prior to joinging Berkeley, I recieved an BEng in Mechanical Engineering and an MSc in Computing (Specialism AI
  and ML), both from Imperial College London. During these, I had the chance of collaborating with researchers 
  such as <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.navarro" target="_blank">Salvador Navarro-Martinez</a>, 
  <a href="http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/arusso/" target="_blank">Alessandra Russo</a>, and 
  <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~da04/" target="_blank">Dalal Alrajeh</a>.

  In the summer 2022, I worked in <a href="https://www.ansys.com/" target="_blank">Ansys'</a> San Jose CTO team on a 
  new generation of PDE numerical solvers powered by physics informred ML. Previously, I gained industrial experience in 
  different tech-focused start-ups: I applied ML to supply chain challenges at 
  <a href="https://www.vekia.fr/en/homepage/" target="_blank">Vekia</a>, and to quality control
  and anomaly detection on images at <a href="https://scortex.io/" target="_blank">Scortex</a> (which has been aqcuired by
  <a href="https://www.trigo-group.com/en" target="_blank">Trigo</a> group).
